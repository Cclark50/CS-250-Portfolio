# CS 250 Sprint Review and Retrospective

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I like to compartmentalize certain ideas until I can get them organized enough to where I can get a clear list of everything the users need.
In doing so I create a list of "User stories" who are formatted in a way where they're labeled, in clear english, what the user needs from the product.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

To approach development is tricky. I usually go with a top down perspective, imagining how the program should look from the beginning and working my way back until I reach what I believe to be the start of the project. The Agile approach is very different, however. I will be incorporating user stories and how they orgainze indiviual parts of development. Developing this way should be much easier to keep track of what needs to be done and what has already been completed.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

If I want to be a good team member I must both communicate effectively but also have self introspection. Communication between team members is extremely important. This is emphasised in the Daily Stand-ups where communicating your successes and roadblocks is key. This is also where self introspection comes in. Being able to recognize where you need to improve is good for the whole team, as you yourself are improving. Recognizing improvement helps everyone involved as the whole team gets stronger in turn. As a team, everyone should be recognizing everyone else's improvments as well.
